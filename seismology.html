<h1>Seismology on a hollow Earth, towards a new model</h1>

<p>This model for how seismic waves from Earthquakes spread, that they loose energy with distance, then converge at other side of Earth, 180째, on a globular hollow planet with a lithosphere crust, and reverberate outwards 40째 in all directions from that point diametrically opposite to epicentre. That model leads to a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_zone">shadow zone</a>" between around 104째 and 140째, fits perfectly with the data.
